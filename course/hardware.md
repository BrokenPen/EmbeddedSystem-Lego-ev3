# Hardware

In this section, I only take about the hardware you may need it.
The Software/OS requirement part in the software.md.

## Computer

Standard computer will be fine, whatever is a Desktop or Notebook.

### Copmuter OS

#### For the school computer running Windows OS

To avoid of trouble shooting in Windows OS, such as install Ethernet Driver for Lego EV3, use putty(ssh) remote access Lego EV3(ev3dev), using WINscp(scp)...

Please use a Linux Live USB, due to most school computer might have installed recovery card by the school computer manage department and also strictly ban student to install software/OS in the computer.

A 4GB Usb Memory Stick will be install to flash as a Linux Live USB,
A 8GB Usb Memory Stick will be better than 4GB Usb Memtory Stick.
A 8GB Usb Memory Stick with Wifi compent will be better than above.

#### For the school computer running Unix-Like OS

Apple Computer with MAS OS or Linux. 
Your school is amazing!

#### For student are require to take their Notebook to the class

Use VMware player, Virtual box to run Linux System is fine.
Install Linux natively on Notebook is the best! 



## Lego EV3

> here isn't recommend you to buy Lego EV3 but only recommend for who already have the Lego EV3

Lego mindstorm EV3 (part 31313) 350USD
Rechargeable Battery (part 45501) 85USD

## micro sd card for Lego EV3

a microSD card is indeed to install ev3dev.

a quota from : http://www.ev3dev.org/docs/getting-started/
> A microSD or microSDHC card (2GB or larger). microSDXC is not supported on the EV3. All cards larger than 32GB will not work with the EV3!

If you don't have a microSD or microSDHC (2GB to 16GB), read the follow, otherwise skip it.

In the 3C market, mircoSD card of 8GB or 16GB which have higher C/P than 2GB/4GB mircoSD card, also better storage size for other Single Board Computer to install OS if you wanna try other SBC later on. 

If you don't have microSD card for Lego EV3, I recommend you buy 8GB or 16GB mircoSD\microSDHC card.

### Wifi dongle for Lego EV3

The Wifi dongle on Lego EV3 is a optional hardware for setup wireless connection between Computer and Lego EV3.

If you already can connect Lego EV3 through Wifi dongle, skip this section!

The Wifi dongle work on Lego EV3

- edimax would be fine
- try what you have that is work and buy as you need

Some cheap Wifi dongle should avoid which don't work on Lego EV3.

- rtk8188us, the chip is often use in the China Brand cheap Wifi dongle under 3USD.
- 360 generateion 3 Wifi dongle, which dont support Linux, Lego EV3(ev3dev) too.
